# FinalBouncingBall_EvanMiserendino
This was a Project for Video#3 in CSCI 201. The edits I made to this Program Was:
1.Add a new audio sound from online. I converted it to an MP3 and added it to the program
2. Changed the textbox to Hyperspeed! I also changed the colors of the balls to all ont color to match the textbox and give it a grey theme. 
3. Changed the speed of the balls to make the appear extremely fast for the hyperspeed theme
This Program contains music and balls going around super fast with the theme of hyperspeed. Below is screen shot of the program but the balls are really moving around and
slamming into the wall.
